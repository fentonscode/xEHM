WIP: This will be a tutorial that shows how to use the default installation to perform basic history matching analyses

Coming soon:

- A simple introduction to history matching as the discovery of the posterior of the calibrated input distribution(s) via:
  - A 1D trigonometric function designed to show multiple modes in the joint distribution
  - A 2D quad-normal mixture designed to show the limits of na√Øve clustering
